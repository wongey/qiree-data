# qiree-data

This repository showcases the unprocessed results from using the Quantum Intermediate Representation Execution Engine (QIR-EE) tool on a variety of different backends, including results from quantum simulators and quantum hardware. This repo serves as a digital companion to the paper "A Cross-Platform Execution Engine for the Quantum Intermediate Representation" (pre-print link to be made available soon) and only contains data artifacts and not the QIR-EE implementation itself.

These results come from the current version of the tool as of this writing (0.1).
