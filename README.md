# qiree-data

This repository showcases the unprocessed results from using the Quantum Intermediate Representation Execution Engine (QIR-EE) tool on a variety of different backends, including results from quantum simulators and quantum hardware. This repo serves as a digital data companion to the paper [A Cross-Platform Execution Engine for the Quantum Intermediate Representation](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.14299) and only contains data artifacts and not the QIR-EE implementation itself.

These results come from the current version of the tool as of this writing (0.1).
